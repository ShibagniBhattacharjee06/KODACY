## 🚀 Projects Built

| 🔧 Project | 💬 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| **✨ LED Blinker** | My first embedded system — blinking an LED with Arduino. |
| **🚧 Obstacle Avoidance Robot** | Used ultrasonic sensors to detect and avoid obstacles autonomously. |
| **➿ Line Follower** | A robot that follows a defined path using IR sensors and motor logic. |
| **🧠 Maze Solver** | Logic-based maze-following robot built on top of the line follower bot. |
| **🎮 Joystick-Controlled Robot** | Controlled a robot in real-time using a joystick module. |
